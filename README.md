🤔About the Project:
------

The game is an automated version of a classic card game where users can play with the computer. 
I used a timer on the game, using the Java util timer’ class to make the game running after each play session.

Features:
----
The game compare the value of each card returned by the two players, and print the final score of each player, the winner' name or prints "DRAW" if the score is tied.

A Deck constructor method:

```
//the constructor, when a new Deck is instantiated
	
	public Deck() {

		//we know each card has a name and value
		
		//let create a List to return a type of  card
		List<String> type = Arrays.asList("Diamonds", "Clubs", "Hearts", "Spades");
		
		//outer looping through the value 2-14
		for(int i=2; i<= 14; i++) {
			
			//inner looping the card type
			for(String str: type) {
				
				//creating a new card
				cards.add(new Card(i, str));
			}
		}
		
	}
```

Method to print a Player info
----
```
/*
	 * prints out information about the player and calls 
	 * the describe method for each card in the Hand List
	 */
	public void describe() {
		//printing player info
		System.out.println("Player: " + name
				+"\n"
				);
		
		//printing card info in hand list
		for(Card c : this.hand) {
			c.describe();
		}
	}
```
